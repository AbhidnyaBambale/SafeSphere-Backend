```

#### After (✅ FIXED):
```typescript
// Correct endpoints with /api/ prefix

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

### ✅ Implemented

1. **Type Safety**
   - All API responses properly typed
   - TypeScript interfaces match backend DTOs
   - No `any` types without fallbacks

2. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks in all async operations
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Graceful fallbacks

3. **Loading States**
   - Loading indicators on all API calls
   - Disabled buttons during operations
   - Pull-to-refresh support

4. **Permission Handling**
   - Location permissions requested before use
   - Proper permission denied handling
   - Fallback UIs when permissions missing

5. **Data Validation**
   - Input validation on forms
   - Coordinate validation
   - Required field checking

6. **User Experience**
   - Loading spinners
   - Error retry buttons
   - Empty state messages
   - Success confirmations

---

## 📈 Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**
   - Removed duplicate API methods
   - Consolidated type definitions
   - Optimized imports

2. **Faster API Calls**
   - Proper endpoint URLs (no 404s)
   - Correct HTTP methods
   - Proper request bodies

3. **Better State Management**
   - Centralized Redux slices
   - No prop drilling
   - Efficient re-renders

4. **Location Caching**
   - User location stored in state
   - Reused across screens
   - Reduces location API calls

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Backend Missing Features

1. **JWT Authentication** (Optional Enhancement)
   - Backend currently doesn't return JWT tokens
   - Frontend expects tokens but handles missing gracefully
   - Can be added later without breaking changes

2. **Emergency Contacts CRUD** (Not Implemented)
   - Backend stores as comma-separated string
   - Frontend has full CRUD UI
   - No backend endpoints yet
   - Low priority

3. **Location Tracking** (Not Implemented)
   - No LocationController in backend
   - Frontend has location service
   - Can be added if needed

### External API Limitations

1. **OpenWeatherMap Free Tier**
   - Weather alerts require paid subscription
   - Current weather works fine
   - Manual alert creation available as workaround

2. **Google Maps API**
   - Not fully integrated for route visualization
   - Routes calculated on backend
   - Map display can be added later

## 📝 Configuration Required

### Before Running

1. **Update API Keys** in `SafeSphere.API/appsettings.json`:
```json
{

    }
  }
}
```

2. **Update Frontend Environment** in `SafeSphere-Frontend/src/config/environment.ts`:
```typescript
export const ENV = {
  API_BASE_URL: 'http://YOUR_BACKEND_IP:5297/api',  // Update with your backend IP
  GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE',
  IS_DEVELOPMENT: __DEV__,
};
```

3. **Start Backend**:
```bash
cd SafeSphere.API
dotnet run
```
