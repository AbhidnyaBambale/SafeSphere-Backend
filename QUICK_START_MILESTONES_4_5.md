## 🔑 API Key Setup (Optional)

### OpenWeatherMap API
1. Get free API key from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Update `SafeSphere.API/appsettings.json`:
```json
"OpenWeatherMap": {
  "ApiKey": "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY",
  "BaseUrl": "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5"
}
```
3. Restart backend

**Note**: The app works with demo data without API key, but real weather requires valid key.

## 📊 Database Tables

New tables created automatically:
- ✅ **UnsafeZones** - Threat locations
- ✅ **SafeRoutes** - Calculated routes
- ✅ **WeatherAlerts** - Weather warnings
- ✅ **DisasterAlerts** - Emergency notifications

Check with pgAdmin or psql:
```sql
SELECT * FROM "UnsafeZones";
SELECT * FROM "SafeRoutes";
SELECT * FROM "WeatherAlerts";
SELECT * FROM "DisasterAlerts";
```

---

## 🔍 Quick Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start
```bash
# Check database connection
psql -U postgres -d safesphere_db

# Reapply migrations if needed
dotnet ef database update --force
```

### Mobile App Can't Connect
1. Check backend is running: `http://YOUR_IP:5297/health`
2. Verify IP address in `api.config.ts`
3. Ensure both devices on same WiFi
4. Check firewall isn't blocking port 5297

### Location Not Working
1. Check device location settings
2. Grant permissions in app
3. Try restarting app
4. Check GPS is enabled

### No Weather Data
1. Verify internet connection
2. Check OpenWeatherMap API key (if configured)
3. Check backend logs for API errors
4. Try different location coordinates

## 🎯 Quick API Tests

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5297/health
```

### Calculate Safe Route
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5297/api/route/safe?userId=1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "originLat": 40.7128,
    "originLng": -74.0060,
    "destinationLat": 40.7589,
    "destinationLng": -73.9851
  }'
```

### Get Current Weather

curl "http://localhost:5297/api/weather/current?latitude=40.7128&longitude=-74.0060"
```

### Report Unsafe Zone
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5297/api/route/zones/unsafe?userId=1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

## 📱 Mobile App Navigation

Add new screens to your navigation (if using React Navigation):

```typescript
// In App.tsx or navigation config
import SafeRouteScreen from './src/screens/SafeRouteScreen';
import WeatherAlertsScreen from './src/screens/WeatherAlertsScreen';

// Add to your tab navigator or stack
<Tab.Screen name="SafeRoute" component={SafeRouteScreen} />
<Tab.Screen name="Weather" component={WeatherAlertsScreen} />
```
